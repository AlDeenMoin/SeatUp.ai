# SeatUp.ai

## Project Overview

SeatUp.ai is an intelligent office seating management platform that leverages AI and 3D visualization to optimize workspace allocation and improve employee experience. The platform enables organizations to efficiently manage office seating arrangements, visualize office layouts in 3D, and make data-driven decisions about workspace utilization.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- Redux for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- Redis for caching
- JWT for authentication
- RESTful API architecture

### AI/ML
- Python with FastAPI
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML models
- OpenAI API integration
- Pandas for data analysis

### DevOps
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- AWS/Azure for cloud infrastructure
- Terraform for infrastructure as code

## UI Design Vision - Animus-Inspired Interface

SeatUp.ai features a cutting-edge user interface inspired by the Animus technology from Assassin's Creed, creating an immersive, futuristic experience for office space management.

### Core Visual Effects

#### 1. Data/Glitch Effect
- **Implementation**: Simulates corrupted or fragmented data during transitions
- **Usage**: When loading office layouts, switching floors, or processing seat assignments
- **Effect**: Flickering polygons, fragmented shapes, and jittery lines that give the impression of accessing digital memories
- **Technical**: CSS animations with transform matrices, WebGL shaders for advanced effects

#### 2. White Flash / Fade Transitions
- **Implementation**: Fade-to-white transition effects between major UI states
- **Usage**: Navigation between different office views, entering/exiting booking flows
- **Effect**: Creates the feeling of "entering a new dimension" or being transported to different office spaces
- **Technical**: Opacity animations with bright white overlays, timing coordinated with data loading

#### 3. Scanline / Grid / Wireframe Overlay
- **Implementation**: Dynamic scanline and grid overlays on 3D models and UI elements
- **Usage**: Real-time rendering indication, system processing states, data analysis visualization
- **Effect**: Shows the "simulation being rendered" in real time, emphasizing the technological nature
- **Technical**: SVG patterns, CSS grid overlays, Three.js wireframe materials for 3D elements

#### 4. Morph / Fragmentation Effects
- **Implementation**: Fragmented morphing and particle dispersion during state changes
- **Usage**: Seat assignments, office reconfigurations, user profile transitions
- **Effect**: UI elements appear to break into pieces before reforming, creating "deconstruction/reconstruction" feel
- **Technical**: Particle systems with Three.js, CSS transforms with staggered animations

### UI Components with Animus Styling

- **Navigation**: Holographic-style menus with glitch transitions
- **3D Viewport**: Wireframe overlays with scanline effects during loading
- **Data Panels**: Semi-transparent panels with digital noise textures
- **Buttons/Controls**: Geometric shapes with fragmentation hover effects
- **Loading States**: Data-corruption animations with white flash completion
- **Notifications**: Glitch-in animations with digital distortion

### Color Palette
- Primary: Electric blue (#00D4FF) and white (#FFFFFF)
- Accent: Digital green (#00FF88) for active states
- Background: Deep space gray (#0A0A0F) with subtle noise
- Warning: Glitch red (#FF0066) for errors
- Text: Clean white with subtle glow effects

## Architecture Summary

The application follows a microservices architecture:

- **Frontend Layer**: React-based SPA communicating with backend via REST APIs
- **API Gateway**: Express.js server handling authentication and request routing
- **Core Services**: Modular backend services for user management, seating logic, and analytics
- **AI Service**: Separate Python service for ML predictions and optimizations
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage, Redis for caching
- **3D Rendering**: Client-side Three.js integration for office visualization
