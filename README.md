# SeatUp.io

## Project Overview

SeatUp.io is an intelligent office seating management platform that leverages AI and 3D visualization to optimize workspace allocation and improve employee experience. The platform enables organizations to efficiently manage office seating arrangements, visualize office layouts in 3D, and make data-driven decisions about workspace utilization.

- Redux for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- Redis for caching
- JWT for authentication
- RESTful API architecture

### AI/ML
- Python with FastAPI
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML models
- OpenAI API integration
- Pandas for data analysis

### DevOps
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- AWS/Azure for cloud infrastructure
- Terraform for infrastructure as code

## UI Design Vision - Animus-Inspired Interface

SeatUp.io features a cutting-edge user interface inspired by the Animus technology from Assassin's Creed, creating an immersive, futuristic experience for office space management.

### Core Visual Effects

#### 1. Data/Glitch Effect
- **Implementation**: Simulates corrupted or fragmented data during transitions
- **Usage**: When loading office layouts, switching floors, or processing seat assignments
- **Effect**: Flickering polygons, fragmented shapes, and jittery lines that give the impression of accessing digital memories
- **Technical**: CSS animations with transform matrices, WebGL shaders for advanced effects

#### 2. White Flash / Fade Transitions
- **Implementation**: Fade-to-white transition effects between major UI states
- **Usage**: Navigation between different office views, entering/exiting booking flows
- **Effect**: Creates the feeling of "entering a new dimension" or being transported to different office spaces
- **Technical**: Opacity animations with bright white overlays, timing coordinated with data loading

#### 3. Scanline / Grid / Wireframe Overlay
- **Implementation**: Dynamic scanline and grid overlays on 3D models and UI elements
- **Usage**: Real-time rendering indication, system processing states, data analysis visualization
- **Effect**: Moving horizontal scanlines, geometric grid patterns, and wireframe outlines that evoke the Animus data-reading experience
- **Technical**: Canvas overlays, CSS pseudo-elements with animations, SVG patterns

#### 4. Holographic / Projection Effects
- **Implementation**: Subtle shimmer and holographic distortions on key UI elements
- **Usage**: Important notifications, selected seats, highlighted areas in 3D view
- **Effect**: Semi-transparent layers with chromatic aberration, giving elements a holographic quality
- **Technical**: Multiple layered elements with opacity gradients, CSS filters (blur, hue-rotate)

#### 5. UI Panel Animations
- **Implementation**: Dynamic panel reveals and transitions with Animus-style edges
- **Usage**: Sidebar navigation, modal windows, data panels
- **Effect**: Panels that materialize with geometric patterns, sharp angular corners, and subtle particle effects
- **Technical**: Clip-path animations, transform transitions, particle systems with Canvas/WebGL

#### 6. Typography & Interface Elements
- **Implementation**: Futuristic fonts with occasional data corruption effects
- **Usage**: Throughout the interface, particularly in data-heavy sections
- **Effect**: Clean sans-serif fonts that occasionally flicker or show digital artifacts during loading states
- **Technical**: Custom font loading, text-shadow for glow effects, random character substitution animations

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep blues (#1a2332, #2d3e50) - Dark, professional base
- **Accent**: Bright cyan/electric blue (#00d9ff, #0099cc) - Animus signature color
- **Highlights**: White (#ffffff) and light gray (#e0e0e0) for contrast
- **Warning/Alert**: Amber (#ffa500) with glitch effect for critical actions
- **Success**: Cyan-green (#00ffcc) for confirmations
- **Background**: Very dark blue-black (#0a0f1a) for depth

### Animation Timing
- **Micro-interactions**: 100-200ms for instant feedback
- **State transitions**: 300-500ms for smooth but noticeable changes
- **Page transitions**: 600-800ms for the full Animus experience
- **Glitch effects**: 50-150ms rapid sequences for authentic corrupted data feeling
