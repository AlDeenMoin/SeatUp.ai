# SeatUp.ai

## Project Overview
SeatUp.ai is an intelligent office seating management platform that leverages AI and 3D visualization to optimize workspace allocation and improve employee experience. The platform enables organizations to efficiently manage office seating arrangements, visualize office layouts in 3D, and make data-driven decisions about workspace utilization.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- Redux for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- Redis for caching
- JWT for authentication
- RESTful API architecture

### AI/ML
- Python with FastAPI
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML models
- OpenAI API integration
- Pandas for data analysis

### DevOps
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- AWS/Azure for cloud infrastructure
- Terraform for infrastructure as code

## Architecture Summary

The application follows a microservices architecture:

- **Frontend Layer**: React-based SPA communicating with backend via REST APIs
- **API Gateway**: Express.js server handling authentication and request routing
- **Core Services**: Modular backend services for user management, seating logic, and analytics
- **AI Service**: Separate Python service for ML predictions and optimizations
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage, Redis for caching
- **3D Rendering**: Client-side Three.js integration for office visualization
